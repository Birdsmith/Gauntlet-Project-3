# Language Learning TikTok Clone - Consumer Vertical Slice

## Project Overview
A TikTok-style mobile application focused on language learning through short-form video content. The app will enable users to discover, consume, and track their progress through bite-sized language lessons.

## Core Value Proposition
- Learn languages through engaging, short-form video content
- Personalized learning path based on skill level
- Track progress and maintain learning streaks
- Discover native speakers and teachers
- Practice listening comprehension at various speeds

## User Stories (Week 1 MVP)
1. "As a language learner, I want to select my target language and level so I can see relevant content"
2. "As a language learner, I want to browse a feed of language lessons filtered by my selected language/level"
3. "As a language learner, I want to watch lessons with captions to aid my understanding"
4. "As a language learner, I want to save lessons to watch later"
5. "As a language learner, I want to track which lessons I've completed"
6. "As a language learner, I want to adjust video playback speed to match my comprehension level"
