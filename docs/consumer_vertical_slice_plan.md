# Consumer Vertical Slice Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines our plan to implement a vertical slice of ReelAI focusing on the Content Consumer experience. We'll build a complete video consumption experience that allows users to discover, view, and engage with content.

## User Type & Niche
- **Primary User Type**: Content Consumer
- **Specific Niche**: Fitness Enthusiast looking for workout routines
  - This niche provides clear use cases for AI features and engagement metrics
  - Workout videos have natural segmentation (warm-up, main workout, cool down)
  - Clear metadata opportunities (difficulty level, muscle groups, duration)

## Core User Stories
1. "As a fitness enthusiast, I want to browse through a feed of workout videos so I can find new exercises to try"
2. "As a fitness enthusiast, I want to filter videos by workout type (cardio, strength, yoga) so I can find specific routines"
3. "As a fitness enthusiast, I want to save videos to my favorites so I can easily access them later"
4. "As a fitness enthusiast, I want to track which workouts I've completed so I can maintain my fitness journey"
5. "As a fitness enthusiast, I want to rate the difficulty of workouts so I can help others find appropriate content"
6. "As a fitness enthusiast, I want to follow my favorite fitness creators so I never miss their new content"

## Data Structure

### User Collection
```firestore
users/{userId}
{
  uid: string,
  email: string,
  displayName: string,
  preferences: {
    favoriteWorkoutTypes: string[],
    preferredDifficulty: string
  },
  following: string[],
  savedVideos: string[],
  completedWorkouts: {
    videoId: string,
    completedAt: timestamp
  }[]
}
```

### Videos Collection
```firestore
videos/{videoId}
{
  title: string,
  description: string,
  creatorId: string,
  uploadDate: timestamp,
  metadata: {
    workoutType: string,
    difficulty: string,
    duration: number,
    muscleGroups: string[]
  },
  stats: {
    views: number,
    likes: number,
    averageRating: number
  },
  videoUrl: string,
  thumbnailUrl: string
}
```

## Success Metrics
- User can successfully complete all 6 user stories
- Smooth video playback experience
- < 2 second load time for video feed
